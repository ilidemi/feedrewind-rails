# FeedRewind (initial Rails version)

A web app that can take an arbitrary blog, discover the full list of posts from it and serve an RSS feed that starts at the beginning and populates on a specified schedule.

It was initially built in Ruby on Rails then rewritten to Go for performance reasons. The Go version can be found [here](https://github.com/ilidemi/feedrewind), and this codebase is only published for the sake of posterity/comparison.
