Either a desktop app that embeds a tab of Chromium or a Chrome extension + some way to get data into it (for example, local server)

Highlight items on the page matching xpath/feed: xpath+feed orange, xpath yellow, last item blue (so that I can check it is the one I think it is)
tooling/highlight_xpath.js

Always display the result with extra
Always display the skipped feed links and their indices

long_feed: is there an archives page or a paged match? Maybe run the main logic for long feed too?
archives (all variations): open the page, highlight, confirm no extra links at the end, confirm no extra shuffled links in the middle or somewhere
archives_categories: open each category, highlight, switch between them with hotkeys. let's say no tracking of last because each of them would have last?
paged: open first page, highlight, check it's the main one. if a page in the middle has a count not matching, have a hotkey and switch to it (with highlight). if uneven pages but there are archives2level counters, sum those up manually. check the last post on the last page.
