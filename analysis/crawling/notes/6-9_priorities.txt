Stable state
    MP is unreliable
    Reports are garbled
    Where is the CPU time going?
    Why was it doing extra requests?
Next work
    Rule about archives says it's good but it's not good
    Unclear what is next page
    There is a ton of work in classifying the blogs
    Maybe look through some sample manually and classify them
    Also add a comment for known bogus ones (or that's later?)
    I am not trying to solve it in my head before I have data

1. Reliability: MP, reports, profile, requests - done. Profile says extract_links is bad, I'll get to it once I know how should historical rules look like.
2. Exploration on what registered as archives, then the rest. Write comments to db so that they show up in report. I'm ok if there are many kinds. I need to see the big picture first, just like yesterday.
3. If reliability comes up, take it first and understand what I'm doing.
